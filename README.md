# Customer Segmentation (Clustering)

A machine learning project that performs customer segmentation using unsupervised clustering algorithms to identify distinct customer groups and enable targeted marketing strategies.

## Overview

This project analyzes customer personality data to segment customers based on their demographics, purchasing behavior, and campaign responses. By identifying distinct customer groups, businesses can optimize marketing efforts and improve customer engagement.

## Dataset

**Source**: [Customer Personality Analysis - Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/imakash3011/customer-personality-analysis)


## Technologies Used

- Python 3.x
- Pandas, NumPy
- Scikit-learn
- Matplotlib, Seaborn
- Jupyter Notebook


## Methodology

1. **Data Cleaning**: Handle null values and outliers
2. **Feature Engineering**: Create meaningful features (e.g., total spending, customer age)
3. **EDA**: Visualize distributions and correlations
4. **Dimensionality Reduction**: Apply PCA if needed
5. **Clustering**: Apply multiple algorithms and compare results
6. **Evaluation**: Use metrics like Silhouette Score for validation
7. **Profiling**: Analyze and interpret each customer segment

## Results

The analysis identifies distinct customer segments with unique characteristics, enabling:
- Targeted marketing campaigns
- Personalized product recommendations
- Optimized resource allocation
- Improved customer retention strategies
